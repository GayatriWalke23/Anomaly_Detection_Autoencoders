#Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection
###Introduction
This project uses autoencoder models to detect anomalies in the machine_temperature_system_failure.csv dataset from the realKnownCause category. The dataset contains temperature readings and timestamps, representing various anomalies in an industrial setting. The models are evaluated based on their ability to reconstruct the input data and detect anomalies effectively.
