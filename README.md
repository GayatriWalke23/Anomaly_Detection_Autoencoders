# Anomaly_Detection_Autoencoders
This project focuses on anomaly detection using autoencoders, specifically targeting the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark dataset. The dataset is highly relevant for practical applications in industrial settings, where anomalies such as planned shutdowns, difficult-to-detect issues, and catastrophic failures are common.
