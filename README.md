# Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection
### Introduction
This project uses autoencoder models to detect anomalies in the machine_temperature_system_failure.csv dataset from the realKnownCause category. The dataset contains temperature readings and timestamps, representing various anomalies in an industrial setting. The models are evaluated based on their ability to reconstruct the input data and detect anomalies effectively.

### Autoencoder Models
- Basic Autoencoder Model
- Deep Autoencoder Model
- Denoising Autoencoder Model
- Dense Autoencoder Model

## Code

You can find the code for the entire project in the Anomaly_Detection_Autoencoders.ipynb file.
## Detailed Report

A comprehensive report detailing the model architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and performance graphs is available in `report.pdf`.
